**RSTF** is a high-performance file archiving utility built in Rust, prioritizing data security through modern encryption and efficient compression. It leverages cutting-edge cryptographic standards to safeguard files against emerging threats.

> Engineered for seamless cross-platform operation

---

## Why RSTF?

Conventional archiving tools often employ outdated security measures vulnerable to contemporary attacks. **RSTF** stands out by integrating robust, forward-looking cryptography.

---

### MacOS Users
Compatible with Intel and Apple Silicon (choose based on your chip)
###### A. For Intel Macs (x86_64):
```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/warchs/rstf-rust/releases/latest/download/rstf-macos-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/rstf
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rstf
```

```bash
rstf --version
```
###### B. For Apple Silicon (ARM64, M1/M2 chips):
```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/warchs/rstf-rust/releases/latest/download/rstf-macos-arm64 -O /usr/local/bin/rstf
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rstf
```

```bash
rstf --version
```

```bash
rstf --help
```
---

### Windows Users
1. Download the appropriate .exe from the [Release Page](https://github.com/warchs/rstf-rust/releases) (MSVC recommended for compatibility, GNU as alternative).
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the download folder.
3. Run: `.\rstf-windows-amd64.exe --help` (or `.\rstf-windows-amd64-gnu.exe --help` for GNU version). (Optional: Add the folder to your PATH for easier access).

---

##  Usage Guide
#### 1. Pack (Encrypt & Compress) Securely archive files or directories.

###### Basic usage (Prompts for password securely):
```bash
rstf pack sensitive_data
```

###### Advanced Mode (Maximum compression + Keyfile + Wipe originals):

```bash
rstf pack ./important_file.py --level 22 --wipe -k ./key_image.jpg
```
> Note: The --wipe flag securely deletes source files after successful archiving.

#### 2. Unpack (Decrypt & Extract) Restore archived data. Provide the password (and keyfile if used).

###### Basic unpack:

```bash
rstf unpack ./sensitive_data.rstf
```
###### Unpack with Keyfile:

```bash
rstf unpack important_file.rstf -k ./key_image.jpg
```

#### 3. List Contents View archive contents without extraction. Credentials are needed since metadata is encrypted.

```bash
rstf list backup.rstf
```

## Technical Details

RSTF implements an **Encrypt-then-MAC** approach using modern cryptographic primitives:

* **Compression: Zstd** (Levels 1-22). Processes data in 64KB chunks for efficient memory use.
* **KDF (Key Derivation): Argon2id** (Version 19). Increases resistance to brute-force by demanding high computational and memory resources, countering GPU clusters.
* **Encryption: XChaCha20-Poly1305.** A performant authenticated stream cipher.
* **Randomness:** Relies on the OS's cryptographically secure random number generator (via the rand crate) for salts and nonces.

---

## Important Security Notice
**This software contains no backdoors.** Loss of your password or keyfile will make data irrecoverable. RSTF's cryptography is designed to resist brute-force attacks. Always secure backups and use strong, unique passwords.
